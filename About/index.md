   KylerKomix is a website for comics made by Kyler Adams!
   
   ![Welcome](/KylerKomix/welcome1.png)
  
KylerKomix is made by Kyler Adams to get better at drawing and share his work ( instead of it sitting in the corner of his hard-drive ).
The website is also to help learn coding and MarkDown, along with GitHub pages.

   How the comics are made:
                           Kyler uses an application called Paint.net for most of his work, But when he gets the chance on a actual computer ( not the laptop he uses some of the time ),
                           he uses Krita, an open source free Animation and drawing application (he uses windows 10 for all the applications and such).
                           
   
   (more coming soon because I have to do other stuff, work on bugs, add features, and work on comics!)
